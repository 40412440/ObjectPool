# ObjectPooling for Unreal Engine

### What is object pooling?

Object Pooling is a great way to optimize your projects and lower the burden that is placed on the CPU when having to rapidly create and destroy GameObjects. It is a good practice and design pattern to keep in mind to help relieve the processing power of the CPU to handle more important tasks and not become inundated by repetitive create and destroy calls. 


With this plugin you can create and use object pooling straight from your blueprints, any class (inheriting from an actor) can become a pool element without any changes!
UE4ObjectPooling Plugin is a single class in C++ that contains all needed functions exposed to blueprints. There is no need to use C++.
